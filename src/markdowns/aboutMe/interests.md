## Interests

I love watching anime (you can tell from my email alone haha). My favorite anime used to be Naruto, but the ending
of Attack On Titan took the title. I also am an avid reader. I primarily read non-fiction with subjects focused
around psychology, psysiology, human behavior, finance/economics, technology, and other miscellaneous
subjects. I'm also a massive Chicago Bears fan (Bear Down!) and crossing my fingers we actually have a competent QB for
once in our franchise.
