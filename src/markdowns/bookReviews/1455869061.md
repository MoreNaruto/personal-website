# "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman

***Completed Reading February 19th 2016***

Amazing book about the two parts of the human brain. System 1 (as Daniel calls it) is the quick responsive part of the brain that makes quick and instinctive decisions while System 2 is makes rational and calculated decisions. To make a summary in short, our System 2 is only used when necessary (e.g. solving a computational problem such as 24 x 47). System 1 makes most of our decisions and our 'gut' feeling when responding to on the spot problems.

Overall, if you're interested in the human brain and how decisions are made, this is a great book.
