# "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins

***Completed Reading April 4th 2016***

In essence, this book really focuses on genes replicate and try to figure out the best ways to survive. It's been happening ever since genes have existed.

The beauty of this concept is that every living body (e.g. Plants, Reptiles, Mammals, Insects, etc...) all evolved due to each gene replicating and combining together to make certain key features for these living bodies to survive in their habit.

Also in the living bodies, most genes main way of surviving is through generations (i.e. reproduction). This also explains why we have key features from our mother and father (23 chromosomes from our mother and 23 chromosomes from our father).

This explains why natural selection and evolution exists through each species. For example, a rabbit trying to escape a fox will have genes that will be alert to certain sounds and move faster than the typical fox. This is from the rabbit's parents, grandparents, and so on passing their instinctual and speedy genes, because they survived because of it.

This is really great book to read if you're interested in how and why certain species of animals do certain actions/tasks through their genes (e.g. A cuckoo bird lays her egg in another birds nest).
