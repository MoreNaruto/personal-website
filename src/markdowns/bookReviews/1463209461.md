# "The 5 Love Languages" by Gary Chapman

***Completed Reading May 14th 2016***

I must say, this book was rejuvenating and thought provoking about approaches to having a long lasting relationship. Asia Thomas and I have both decided to read this book in order to learn the question that almost every single relationship wants to know, "What is love?"

Well, I don't know what the exact definition is because love comes in many shapes and forms, but I did learn that in order to love someone, you have to learn and do what they love. And by this, every person has their own way of feeling love. It's a language, as one can put it, and most of the time, our significant other speaks a different one.

Here are the 5 main love languagues:
1. Quality Time
2. Words of Affirmation
3. Acts of Service
4. Receiving Gifts
5. Physical Touch

For me personally, I learned my top 2 are physical touch and quality time.

In essence, I learned from Asia Thomas and from this book that love is a discipline. In order to make your partner or significant other feel loved, you need to speak their language of love. Otherwise, their love tank will deplete and eventually become empty.

I highly recommend this book to any couples. It's a short and very good read.
