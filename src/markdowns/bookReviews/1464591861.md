# "Living with a SEAL" by Jesse Itzler

***Completed Reading May 30th 2016***

I have to say, this book is by far the funniest combined with motivational book I've ever read!

I give my condolences to Jesse Itzler for doing a month long extreme workout regiment that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger quake in his boots.

This book was hilarious but also gave me fire to my workouts. I will always think, no matter how hard a workout will be, it can't be any worse than a 42 year old man doing a workout of a Navy SEAL. (This is shoutout to Sarah Grace LeBlanc  and Dexter D Teng whose been my crossfit buddies for 7 months)!

This made me realize that there is no excuses for reaching greatness and going past your potential!

P.S. Thanks Aubrey Chipman for recommending this book! You're awesome!
