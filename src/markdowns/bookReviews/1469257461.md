# "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo

***Completed Reading July 23rd 2016***

Africa is a continent rich with resources, culture, and people. How can a country with these amenities be in such a state of poverty, corruption, and warfare?

Well, Dambisa Moyo, a Zambian woman, explains how foreign aid is a veil that appears to be helping the continent but instead caused more economic issues and governmental corruption. Since foreign aid is free money given to the government and with the government having little to no regulations, corruptions runs rampant with millions of foreign aid being abused and given to select few individuals.

What I really like about this book is that Dambisa addresses the issue in addition to giving solutions that many countries in Africa can use to improve their country. Here are five of the top solutions she has given.
1. Capital trade
2. FDI
3. Free trade
4. Micro-loans (for smaller entrepreneurs/poor sectors)
5. Remmitances

There is so much information in this book that can shine light on the overall issues in the continent of Africa. This is probably one of the best books I've read and it's also a great provider for the personal app I am currently working on.
