# "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C Martin

***Completed Reading October 14th 2016***

As a Software Developer, one of the most important concepts you will ever learn and need to hone your skills around is clean code.

If you've been in the business long enough, you've seen code that made you want to find that developer and wag five fingers at them for the atrocity they created. Even myself, I look back at my previous implementations and wonder, "What the hell was I thinking that day?" haha.

Robert gives us guidelines on how to properly test drive your code and refactor it, so other developers can easily pick up where you left off. Robert gives multiple tips and code smells that developers should watch out for whenever they are coding or reviewing their peers' code.

I personally want to be a developer that commits to making a codebase clean and easy to navigate through, and I feel more developers need to do the same.

I recommend this book to any developer or soon to be developers. One of the major factors that distinguish a normal developer to a professional developer is code quality, and I plan to be better than the professional developer ðŸ™‚
