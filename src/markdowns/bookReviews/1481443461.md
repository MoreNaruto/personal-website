# "Software Systems Architecture" by Nick Rozanski and Eoin Woods

***Completed Reading December 11th 2016***

Having worked in the software industry for the past 2.5 years, I can't deny that I've been intrigued with what goes on behind the scenes with decision making in what I'm developing. I mean if I'm going to be involved in the production of software that will renovate some faction of society, I would like to know how everything initially started and how certain software frameworks are incorporated into the architecture over others. Or better yet, why not be involved at the beginning?

One day I want to be a software architect, but the best way to learn is through personal experiences and others approaches. This book gives a great amount of detail about how to be a software architect in a large enterprise.

The main focuses of this book is on three subject matters:
1. Stakeholders
2. Viewpoints
   1. Functional
   2. Information
   3. Concurrency
   4. Development
   5. Deployment
   6. Operational
3. Perspectives
   1. Security
   2. Performance
   3. Availability
   4. Evolution
   5. Usability
   6. Accessibility
   7. Location
   8. Regulation
   9. Internalization

In addition to these focuses, Nick and Eoin has an agile mindset of everything changes in industry at any given moment, so involve stakeholders and make sure diagrams and architecture is up-to-date, so everyone is on the same page.
