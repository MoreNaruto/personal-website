# "Why There is No God" by Armin Navabi

***Completed Reading December 20th 2016***

In a nutshell, this book responds to twenty common responses to the existence of God. From 'how does someone have morality?' to 'what happens in the afterlife?', this book explains the arguments origin and how to appropriately respond to it.

The title makes the book sound harsher than it actually is. This book makes every reader from fundamentalist of a religion to stern atheists question religion and their own sense of being.

For me, I became an atheist from questioning my existence and the existence of the planet. Honestly, that what makes me enjoy my time on this planet. I don't want to agree or conform to the status quo or theories without some evidence of the reasoning. It makes me learn and grow as a person the more I learn about the unknown.

There some things in this book I don't fully agree with, but overall, this books hit on points that made me become an atheist years ago. Honestly, I want to understand all cultures and religions. For me, when different cultures and religions truly understand each other, I think that will lead to a true utopia and ever lasting peace in the world.
