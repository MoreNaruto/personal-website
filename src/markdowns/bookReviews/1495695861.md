***Completed Reading May 25th 2017***

I'll make this review real short and simple, because this book is pretty straightforward.

One of the biggest challenges of running a tech company is management and retention. With a boom in technology and software development, software developers are in high demand. This changes the standard of advancement in a company from excelling within the company to experience from different companies for advancement.

For managers, they have to figure out:
1. How to deliver effectively, quickly, and consistently
2. Making your team happy and looking out for their best interest
3. Recruiting developers who want to be successful and driven to learn something new everyday
4. Advancing yourself as a manager intellectually and socially
   
This book dives into each of these issues and making it so not only is the team successful but love working with each other.
