# "Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom" by Van K. Tharp

***Completed Reading October 4th 2017***

Now a days, anyone can create an investment portfolio using a web platform such as Vanguard, TDameritrade, Fidelity, etc. to get involved in the market. There are tons of opportunities in investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, international markets, etc. But, what a lot of people don't do is a deeper dive in reducing risk and maximizing reward.

In this book, Van Tharp with other established investors give different systems that each investor has customized to their personal belief system. That's the thing that Van Tharp really hampers on: Your investment strategy should fit you.

The main three focuses that Van want any investor to have established in their system before they even start investing is: Establishing reward-to-risk ratios, understanding position sizing, and control of your psychological urges.

I would love to go into in-depth detail about these three focuses, but it'll take too much time. So of course to learn more, get this book and start learning how to establish your own investment system.

Thanks!
