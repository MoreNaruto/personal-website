# "The Book on Investing in Real Estate with No (and low) Money Down" By Brandon Turner

***Completed Reading October 22nd 2017***

After reading "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", my journey to becoming a multi-millionaire via real estate started. But one of the biggest questions I had was: How do I start? Ah! The question everyone have when they take on a new challenge. To help me answer that question, I asked people who have successfully become financially independent via real estate investment. In the process, I ran across this great book.

This book by Brandon Turner explains multiple tools the reader can use as an investor to become successful in real estate. From 203k to taking hard loans to influencing people to become partner, there are multiple combinations to successfully make cash flow in the property you acquire. In fact, this book is more about using these different tools to be creative; to think outside of the box to accomplish your goals.

In addition to this book, BiggerPockets is an awesome platform to look at other real estate investors and see what they've done and ask any questions you have to help you succeed. This community is so awesome to have, and you can use this book and community to help you grow your real estate business into your own passive cash flow for multiple years.
