# "How to Influence People and Make Friends" by Dale Carnegie

***Completed Reading November 11th 2017***

It's nice to get out of the realm of real estate and investment and discover the secrets of winning people over. I had a lot of fun reading this book and using the 'tactics' mentioned in the book to help understand people and understanding yourself.

It's amazing how much people want to be understood and feel important, but they themselves don't reciprocate the same feeling towards other people. Everyone wants to feel a sense of worth and importance in life. This sense explains why so many people believe or operate the way they do.

If you want to dig into the realm of influencing and winning people over, I recommend this book. Try some of the techniques in this book, you'll be amazed at the results
