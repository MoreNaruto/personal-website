# "One up on Wall Street" by Peter Lynch

***Completed Reading November 29th 2017***

Wall Street being wrong? Experts about the market having wrong predictions? Is it too late to invest in a stock? Why would invest in a new company?

Well, Peter answers all these questions and then some. In the mindset of a novice investor, can you name four products you would invest in? Or how about products that you use or buy every day that millions of other people are using just as much or even more than you are?

This book breaks the illusion that the 'experts' on wall street have the best scoop on the next big stock to hit the market. It explains how experts are usually late, stagnant, and inflexible due to the restrictions of their firm. This gives us, the individual investors, a huge advantage to get wind of a stock with great potential before they do. And this book explains the best indictors for findings those future ten to two bagger stocks.

It's a new perspective on investing that contradicts some other books I have read in the past on investing in terms of 'hold' and 'sell' signals. Peter is definitely a long-term investing, and if your mindset is in the same or similar realm, I would recommend this book for you.
