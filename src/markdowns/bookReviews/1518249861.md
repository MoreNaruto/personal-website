# "How I Turned $1,000 into Five Million in Real Estate" by William Nickerson

***Completed Reading February 10th 2018***

Even though this book latest edition was released in 1980, it still have some of the most detailed advice about how to become successful in real estate. From finding the right estate to getting the best tenants to building your real estate pyramid, it basically goes through every situation someone getting real estate needs to be aware of.

I recommend taking a highlighter and some notes, because this book has a TON of content. I also suggest looking at what laws and taxes were updated from then to now in terms of benefits and pitfalls of owning real estate.
