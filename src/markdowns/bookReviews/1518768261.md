The most difficult about running a company is running a company. I know, pretty redundant, right? Well, it's true. Over 90% of starts fail. Each one has their own reasons and challenges, but one of the major reasons is not focusing on the problem your company should solve.

This book explains how OKRs (Objective and Key Results) will not only give your company their mission to success but also align everyone to focus on accomplishing that mission. Companies such as Google and Zynga uses OKRs for the company, their projects, and their employees.
