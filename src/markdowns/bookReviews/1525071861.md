# "Tetralogue: I'm Right, You're Wrong" By Timothy Williamson

***Completed Reading April 30th 2018***

Disagreements are intertwined in our society. Most doesn't  come out with solution that makes all parties happy. Governments, corporations, relationships, and even internal dialogs have disagreements.

Our characters: Sarah, Bob, Zac, and Roxanne all have different perspectives on different scenarios on a simple train ride.

Sarah: An absolutist from a factual standpoint, but a relativist by a moral standpoint whom holds a stern stance for scientific reasoning.

Bob: A believer in witches whom want straightforward answers

Zac: A relativist in every sense whom tries to understand everyone's point of view when disagreements arise

Roxanne: A stern rationalists whom believe there is only one answer to any problem and anyone whom opposes is obtuse.

Out of all the characters, I can personally relate most with Sarah than anyone else, because her reasonings for the disagreements all the characters have come from a scientific perspective. The main disagreement I would probably have with Sarah is the approach to any moral dilemmas that I would face and how to respond (If you read the book, you'll understand what I mean).

Thanks Wes Weaver for the recommendation!
