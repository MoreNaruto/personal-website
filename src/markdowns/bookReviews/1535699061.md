# "The Book on Rental Property Investing" by Brandon Turner

***Completed Reading August 31st 2018***

I'm not going to lie. It's pretty daunting to buy a property. Even now, I don't have a property to my name yet. I always wonder to myself why it's so difficult to make that first step into owning a property. Well, I think that Brandon helped me understand more why I haven't made the step yet and how to not only own a property, but build a pyramid with real estate to financial freedom.

Brandon goes through every possible step needed for someone like me to get started. He goes from the start of buying your first property to the end of having passive income for the rest of your life and your children lives. He makes it very clear that there's not a one-stop-shop solution for everyone. Each person will have their own situation, own circumstances, own issues, and own location to handle.

But don't fret, Brandon and millions of other real estate investors on BiggerPockets are more than happy to help people willing to learn and ask for help.

For me personally, I plan on buying a property at some point in the next year. From this, I will steamroll from this property and leverage debt to acquire a rental property in the following six months. With the help from Brandon and millions of others, I'm planning on being financially independent by my mid thirties. I know if millions of others have done it, I know I can too.
