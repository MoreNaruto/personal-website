# "The Moral Landscape" by Sam Harris

***Completed Reading March 4th 2019***

What would you say to the claim that good and bad decisions can be scientifically proven? That all human moral compasses is similar to the studies of human health.

Seems a little excessive right? We've seen in the history of the human race that unknowns have been discovered later on through science. From biology, medicine, neuroscience, chemistry, and so on, these fields of sciences didn't exist until the 20th century. As more evidence gets discovered about the human race and the universe we reside in, we rid (hopefully) proven false narratives from our academic establishments.

Sam Harris discusses the morality of human originates from our primordial ancestors in order to build an altruistic society which would maximize their chance of survival. We can reference multiple humanoid societies that have been wiped from the face of the earth from going against this essential survival mechanism.

The main message I assume that Sam Harris wanted to project to his readers is that maximizing the well-being of all human beings should be the ultimate goal of the human race. International, national, and individual decisions should be made with this thinking in mind.
