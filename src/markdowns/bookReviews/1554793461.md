# "The Greatest Story Ever Told - So Far" By Lawrence M. Krauss

***Completed Reading April 9th 2019***

Theoretical Physicists Lawrence Krauss starts from the beginning of our understanding of how not only our universe was started, but potentially other universes were created.

It all started with the discovery of the light photon. A massless photon that moves at 3.0 x 10^8 m/s steamed rolled discovery after discovery. This led to the discovery of the electromagnetic waves which expanded to such an explosion of new inventions using electricity to power our world.

After multiple discoveries (electrons, protons, neutrons, neutrinos, bosons, muons, pions, quarks, and the Higgs Boson Particle/Higgs Field), physicists are now on the quest to understand how the Higgs Field/Particle plays in stabilizing our universe. In essence, if the Higgs Field exhibited a different mass and/or negative force in our universe, we couldn't have existed. Matter of fact, if the Higgs Field did have those properties, our universe would be condensing rather than expanding.

After reading this book, I am simply in awe of the creation of our universe and life. Physicists like Einstein, Faraday, Higgs, David Gross, Sheldon Glashow and many others have paved the way for understanding our universe and it origins. But even when we discover something remarkable about the universe, more questions and mysteries bubble up as a result.
