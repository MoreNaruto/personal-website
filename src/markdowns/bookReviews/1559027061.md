# "Outliers: The Story of Success" by Malcolm Gladwell

***Completed Reading May 28th 2019***

When you think of someone who is exceptionally successful, what's the first reason that pops in your mind? Is it their generational wealth? Is it the opportunities afforded to them? Or is it just simple luck?

Malcolm Gladwell culminates all these aspects of success into the life of successful people such as Bill Gates, Bill Joy, professional hockey players, Robert Oppenheimer, and many other prestigious individuals. The crazy part is that their success is partly attributed to being at the right place at the right time.

Take Bill Gates for example. If he wasn't given the opportunity to utilize one of the first computers to be accessible in a school setting in 1968, Bill wouldn't have been able to invest the copious amount of hours in software development.

So, whenever you see an affluent figure on your TV screen or in person passing your peripheral, just remember that their success can be attributed to factors that they themselves are completely unaware of.
