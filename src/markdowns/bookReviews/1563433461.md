# "The Sociopaths Guide to Getting Ahead" by P.T. Elliott

***Completed Reading July 18th 2019***

Alright, to all the sociopaths and psychopaths who want to know how to blend in with your co-workers, this book is right up your alley. From impersonating the lovable office employee to gaslighting and disparaging your enemies, this book will walk you through the process of going from zero to CEO of a company as a sociopath.

From all the manipulation books I've read, this is definitely the most sadistic of them all. I mean, P.T. Elliott literally tells the reader to drag an adversary's reputation into the shitter if it means getting a leg up and augmenting your reputation.

To be honest, I had mixed feelings about this book. Some of the techniques I could definitely see working especially with susceptible colleagues. But...I'm not a sociopath. And because of this, I can't, in all good conscious, do some of the techniques P.T. Elliott suggests. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty happy I read this book, so I can be more vigilant of people who try to execute these techniques in any setting.

Personal feelings aside, I did enjoy reading this book and if you're ever curious about how to manipulate colleagues and spread fire in your office space, this book will open that pandora's box for you.
