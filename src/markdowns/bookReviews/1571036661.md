# "Captivate" by Vanessa Van Edwards

***Completed Reading October 14th 2019***

Ever wonder how you can build long lasting relationships with (almost) everyone you meet? Well, Vanessa has written this fantastic book on how to read body language, best places to engage people in social events, how to speed read someone, and how to connect with someone on a personal level.

There's a lot that Vanessa went over, but I think the most important part of the book is figuring out someone via three attributes: Personality, Appreciation Languages, and Professional Drivers. She goes into great depth about how each one operates and how utilizing these three attributes about someone can help you better understand them and how to connect with them.

I really like the final chapter which explains that as long as you stay curious about people you engage with, you will always connect with them, because nothing makes someone feel more important than being valued.

As always, I would recommend this book especially if you're looking to understand why certain people in your life act and respond the way they do.
