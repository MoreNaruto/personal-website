# "The Whole-Brain Child: 12 Revolutionary Strategies to Nurture your Child's Developing Mind" by Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson

***Completed Reading November 11th 2019***

As a father, I want my son to be as successful as possible throughout his life. This is blatantly obvious, but what is not blatantly obvious, or rather conversely, very ambiguous and unknown is how a child will act during specific occasions.

Daniel and Tina goes through how to interact with your children when they go through these episodes of emotional roller coasters. He goes through how to communicate with their left/right brain, their upstairs/downstairs brain, how to bring our implicit experiences and make them explicit, how to get your child into a mindsight state, and how you can make their 'I' into 'We' mentality when interacting with others.

I learned so much about how in the future to make my son aware of his emotions and how to handle them, so he can not only react appropriately when they do arise but also be aware of those emotions which will help him navigate through them.
