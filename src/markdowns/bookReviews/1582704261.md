# “When Breath Becomes Air” By Paul Kalanithi

***Completed Reading February 26th 2020***

What an amazing story about a neurosurgeon-neuroscientist who spent the early part of his career not only saving people lives who were suffering from different forms of cancer, but diving into the moral dilemma about understanding and informing the patient and their families in the most empathetic path he knew about life and death situations. Then in a traumatic twist in his own life, he was placed in the same situation when he was informed his suffered from cancer.

Throughout the book, he discusses this dilemma that people suffer when they are informed about death coming sooner than expected: How should I live the rest of my life? And it’s amazing how he came to terms with his death and decided to tell his story.

Paul Kalanithi had so much to offer to this world and it would have been amazing to see what he would have done if he was able to reach his life goals. It’s a honor to have read this book and listen to his message. And I hope all his readers become inspired by his message.
