# "The Tipping Point" by Malcolm Gladwell

***Completed Reading May 5th 2020***

To start, Malcolm Gladwell is probably one of the Top 5 people I revere the most outside of my family. I've read "Talking to Strangers", "Outliers", and "Blink" before this book, and all of his work has made a lasting impression on me, and this one is no different. So let's dive right into it.

"Tipping Point" focuses on three key concepts that causes a social epidemic:

1. The Power of the Few
2. Stickness (and contagions)
3. The Power of Context

Malcolm uses copious amounts of case studies to validate why these three key points causes certain trends, memes, and cultural phenomenons to explode in our world. From Sesame Street and Blues Clues to resolving crime in Baltimore, all these case studies are pivotal learning points that can be utilized in any medium.

Especially for small businesses trying to gain an edge on competitors or people curious about why certain ideologies has become it's own entity in a culture, I would highly recommend this book. I for one will definitely utilize some of the talking points Malcolm has brought up to augment certain aspects of my career and dive deeper into why a mainstream phenomenon got to a certain point.
