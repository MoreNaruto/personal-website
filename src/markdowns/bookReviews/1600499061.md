This is such a simple story about a chance meeting between a pedagogue and student. Underneath these serendipitous meetings lies these twelve pillars that teaches any person how to truly be successful and have a fulfilling life.

I honestly can't clearly put my thoughts into this synopsis, because I'm still trying to digest the lessons in this book. Even though this is a physically easy read, it's not a mentally easy read, because if you do internalize what the message and lessons of the book, you'll definitely self-reflect on a lot of aspects of your life. From my relationships and career to myself, it makes me think evaluate myself in an uncomfortable but necessary way.

I haven't said this in a while but if you're ready this post, you NEED to read this book. We all need to self reflect no matter how good our life is, because there's always areas in our lives we can improve.
