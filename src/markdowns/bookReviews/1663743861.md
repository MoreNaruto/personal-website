# “Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams” By Matthew Walker, PhD

***Completed Reading September 21st 2022***

Usually I would write a very verbose summary about the book I read, but this book is so crucial to your own personal health and our society that I think it would be inappropriate for me to languish on meaty content and reduce the key points down to spark note style.
The consequences of sleep deprivation
- Weak immune system (The sympathetic nervous system become more haywire)
    - More susceptible to diseases
- Reduce cognitive functions (both short-term [hippocampus] and long term [cortex])
    - Can’t focus on new information
    - Can’t retain the information
- Reduce cardiovascular functions (also impacts physical performance)
    - Risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke
- Less control over emotions (The amygdala)
    - Become more erratic
    - Exhibit similar behavior of a schizophrenic or ADHD person
- Exhibit more micro sleep
    - Becomes one of the major causes of car crashes
- Less motivated
    - In work and in personal life
- Exhibit more insomniac symptoms
    - Can’t sleep well at night and sleep throughout the day
- Increase Obesity
    - Due to a decrease in leptin and increase in ghrelin, your appetite increases which then causes you to eat more than necessary
- Less creative and innovative
    - Due to lack of REM sleep
      What not to do to improve sleep
- Drink Alcohol
    - Alcohol is a sedative that interrupts your NREM/REM sleep
- Take sleeping pills
    - These are also sedatives that not only interrupts your NREM/REM sleep but has harmful side effects
- Paying back sleep debt
    - Just because you slept 4 hours the night before doesn’t mean you can sleep 12 hours the next night to make up the time. During the day, particular regions of the brain is building up a chemical called `adenosine` which basically needs to be flushed away (via a good night of sleep). If not, there will be a residue of adenosine even if you try to “pay back” for past bad night of sleep
- Sleep erratically (on different schedules)
- Sleep with lights on (especially LED)
  What to do to improve sleep
- Get on a regular sleeping schedule
    - Follow your circadian clock to discover which window in time do you sleep well
- CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Theory for Insomnia)
    - If you’re truly having troubles sleeping, try this form of theory
- “Turn off your brain”
    - By this I mean clear your mind for 15-20 minutes before you go to sleep
- Reduce the amount of LED lights engagement before bed
    - There’s also a setting on your laptop/computer that should reduce LED lighting

There’s SOOOOOOO much more information in this book, and I would say it’s a must read for everyone. As I mentioned earlier, proper sleep will dramatically improve your life in every facet possible, but more importantly we have a sleep deprivation crisis in the developed world that is only in the infancy phase of being taken seriously. This is synonymous with how lethargic the government was to take mental health seriously until the mid 2000s. The sleeping crisis is not being properly talked about and it’s impacting our entire society in a myriad of ways.

If you can’t pick up the book, please I implore to at the very least look at my notes and find articles about how sleep impacts EVERYTHING. It’s a ubiquitous problem that isn’t getting the attention it desperately needs.
