# "Startup CEO: A Field Guild to Scaling Up Your Business" by Matt Blumberg

***Completed Reading January 20th 2023***

Matt Blumberg was the former CEO of Return Path (an email deliverability platform). Matt intertwines his experience of turning a start-up with no revenue to a company evaluated at $100 million over 20 years.

Matt dives into a ton of different aspects and challenges of being a start up CEO. From starting a company to selling your start-up, Matt gives really insightful and strategic advice for each stage of a start-up.

What I really enjoyed about this book is how Matt really tries to help current and aspiring CEOs from falling into the same pitfalls he fell into (i.e. utilize a exec coach and exec assistant / make your culture/company mission as transparent, accessible, and unambiguous as possible early on).

I wish I could dive into every section in this book, but there’s so much content and each section is basically a different stage of a startup. So in all honesty, it’s one of those books that once you read it, you’ll want to come back to it based on where your company is at in their life cycle.

If you’re currently/looking to get into the startup world, I would recommend this book as a CEO guide to running a startup!
