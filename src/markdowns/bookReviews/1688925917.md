# "Smarter Tomorrow: How 15 Minutes of Neurohacking a Day Can Help You Work Better, Think Faster, and Get More Done" by Elizabeth R. Ricker

***Completed Reading July 9th 2023***

I find the human brain to be the most fascinating and bewildering organ in our body. Every book I've read about neuroscience, brain anatomy, and the conscious and unconscious mind has always been profound to me. One aspect that consistently surprises me is neuroplasticity, particularly the brain's adaptability based on the environment.

This book delves into the subject of neuroplasticity and focuses on how one can enhance creativity, emotional self-regulation, executive function, memory, and learning through self-experimentation. Elizabeth provides various tools that readers can use to improve in these four areas. She emphasizes that each tool may have different effects on different individuals, so it's important to measure if the experiment genuinely enhances performance.

In summary, if you're seeking a method to enhance your cognitive abilities, I highly recommend reading this book and following its guidelines.
