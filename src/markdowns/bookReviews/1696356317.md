# Sam Harris: Making Sense Podcast Episode #335 - A POSTMORTEM ON MY RESPONSE TO COVID

***Completed Listening October 3rd 2023***

I don’t usually post about podcasts, but there are a ton of points Sam Harris hits on in this podcast episode about the COVID-19 timeline that are worth a conversation. I’m probably gonna have some people who disagree with my stance on the topic, but I’m always open to a healthy dialectic with anyone.

If you ever read any of my synopsis for books pertaining to misinformation overpowering vetted data, the response to COVID-19 in America is the epitome of that. When COVID-19 first hit American soil, there was little to nothing the CDC/WHO organization knew about the virus. And there wasn’t much time for the CDC/WHO organization to do proper trials and testing due to how deadly the coronavirus was (especially for people with preexisting health issues). So a lot of information being presented to the public was a “Work in Progress” approach. And if you go back, there were a lot of restrictions being lifted for the CDC and FDIC in order to expedite the process of getting a vaccine ready (which incorporated CRISPR/Cas9). This also explains why there was so much back and forth early on about whether should people social distancing (public and private), wear masks (are they even effective), travel internationally, etc… coming from the CDC/WHO/FDIC. I’ll rope back to the distrust some people had for the government later on this.

So when the first vaccine became available, it made sense why the general public had some level of trepidation. Is it safe? Was it tested enough? Are there potential side effects? It didn’t help either that Trump was driving his own narrative that contradicted some of the claims from the experts on epidemiology and virology. So seeds of mistrust towards those experts were being planted and other external influencers were stirring an entirely new alternative to combat COVID-19 or downplay its severity.

Fast forward to 2021-2022 where experts have a much better understanding of the different COVID strands, vaccines are much more vetted and tested (and also more ubiquitous), and public engagement in getting back to normalcy, we still have citizens (by the millions) who refuse to get vaccinated. And this is where I’m very concerned about the future of this country if a similar more severe virus were to appear. Due to anti-vaccination rhetoric from the far right of the political aisle, we have people not only putting their own lives at risk but people are immunocompromised at risk with little to no evidence to justify their actions. If you look at this study: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/.../political-party... the death rate of Republican counties to COVID-19 was 15% higher than those of Democratic counties. This isn’t about a particular party being “right or wrong” as to which party was most likely to follow the influencers who denounced vaccines. I’m almost certain a similar pattern would exist for Democratic counties if they were influenced by similar rhetoric.

We live in a society where experts are being overridden by fraudulent think tanks that rather push a narrative than look at the evidence and trust our established institution. There are a lot of things to be critical about with our government, but this shouldn’t be dismissed unless there is unequivocal evidence that our governmental institutions are involved in dubious activities. Well-meaning people are being cajoled by voiceboxes they revere, and it’s causing a very unnecessary rift on a PANDEMIC! I don’t know how many lives could have been saved and it would be ill-advised of me to make such an unfounded claim, but over a million people have died from COVID-19. Just imagine if COVID-19 was at the deadliness level of Ebola or the West Nile Virus. That is a pretty likely scenario that could come up… and we have these bombastic personalities downplaying or outright denying the severity of COVID-19.

I’ll leave you with this analogy (one Sam Harris brings up in this podcast episode):��Every year millions upon millions of Americans travel via planes. You (the traveler) have no idea who the pilot is, who constructed the plane, who does the maintenance checks of the plane, and (mostly) how the plane even operates. And yet, you enter into that plane trusting that 10s-100s of people did an adequate enough job to ensure that the plane reaches its destination. Of course, the system isn’t perfect. We still have malfunctions and plane crashes every once in a while. But overall, you unconsciously and unequivocally trust that in the entire airline process.

Now granted planes have been flown for over a century while COVID-19 is coming up on half a decade, but there are no partisan think tanks saying, “If you get on any flight, you’re putting yourself at risk. Don’t trust the  Wright brothers!”. People in general need to stop being hidebound and trusting someone that matches their worldview, and be more critical about what they’re spoon-fed. I’ve mentioned this multiple times, but our biggest issue in this country is the inability of one tribe to see through the lens of an opposing tribe.
