## Summary

I took a leadership role in fostering a positive work environment and driving technical advancements at ActiveCampaign.

In the realm of people and culture, I led and organized a health check committee. This committee conducted health checks to boost company morale and gather data for leadership to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I spearheaded initiatives and events aimed at enhancing the company's culture, emphasizing a collaborative and engaging workplace.

On the tech front, I was involved in deploying critical systems. For a PHP/Laravel Web Service, I orchestrated deployment via AWS Web Instances, particularly for a Realtime Chat Service. AWS SQS Messages and SNS Topics were skillfully employed to manage jobs, meticulously crafted with Terraform. To monitor and troubleshoot, Kibana and Sentry were invaluable tools for analyzing logs across staging and production environments.

Simultaneously, I tackled a Java/Webflux Service, deployed via AWS Web Instances for a Chatbot. Just as in the previous deployment, AWS SQS Messages, SNS Topics, and Terraform played vital roles in job management. Containerization was embraced, leveraging Kubernetes for both PHP/Laravel and Java/Webflux services, ensuring scalability and resilience. These combined efforts not only elevated company morale and culture but also ushered in robust and scalable technical solutions at ActiveCampaign.
