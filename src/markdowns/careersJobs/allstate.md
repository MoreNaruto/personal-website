## Summary

I was instrumental in the development and deployment of a crowd-sourced mobile application designed to facilitate road-side assistance tasks for Allstate customers.

On the Android platform, I successfully deployed the app to the Google Play Store, streamlining the process through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. To ensure code quality and reliability, SonarCube was employed for comprehensive test coverage analysis. Additionally, Dynatrace was utilized to monitor and manage logs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Simultaneously, I oversaw the deployment of a React/Redux Web Application using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. Just as with the mobile app, SonarCube was used to maintain robust test coverage, while Dynatrace continued to serve as a valuable tool for log management.

These efforts not only ensured the successful launch of the mobile and web applications but also emphasized the commitment to quality, performance, and reliability in delivering road-side assistance services to Allstate customers.
