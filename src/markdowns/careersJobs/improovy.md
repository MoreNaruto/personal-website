# Improovy  / Lead Engineer
***November 2022 - May 2023***

## Key Points

#### People

* Step through with the leadership team (myself included) on a roadmap of what the Improovy product will look like for the next 3-5 years with a fully fleshed-out team
* Weekly meetings with leadership on what the product is building and how expanding on the MVP brings value to our customers and sales team.

#### Tech
* Built 2 Backend Microservices (Java/Spring and Java/Vertx) with a React Frontend pulling data from our MongoDB
  * Built from the ground up where the Java/Spring microservice is an API that any client can communicate with and the Java/Vertx microservice handles queue processing and batch jobs  via RabbitMQ, external API calls, and Kafka  data streaming/processing from/to AWS services
  * React App communicates with the API microservice via GraphQL to then display pages that streamline the onboarding process and improve the process for the Sales team
  * Containerized all these services in Docker with AWS ECS
  * Maintained a couple of Serverless Lambdas written in NodeJS
* Architect Current/Future product work
  * I used LucidChart to create visual designs, including how each high-level component in the system will communicate with each other and which component will be responsible for certain functionality.

## Summary

Efforts within the company spanned both strategic planning and technical innovation.

On the strategic front, a roadmap for the next 3-5 years of the Improovy product was collaboratively crafted with the leadership team, including yourself. This comprehensive vision was designed to guide the product's evolution with a fully equipped team. Weekly meetings with leadership provided a crucial forum for product development discussions, elucidating how expanding upon the MVP would yield value for customers and the sales team.

From a technical perspective, significant strides were made. Two Backend Microservices were meticulously built, one with Java and Spring, and another with Java and Vertx. These services, supported by a React Frontend, interacted with a MongoDB hosted on Containerized Docker Image with Amazon ECS. The Java/Spring microservice acted as a versatile API, accessible to any client, while the Java/Vertx counterpart handled queue processing, batch jobs via RabbitMQ, external API calls, and data streaming/processing with AWS services. The React App effectively communicated with the API microservice through GraphQL, streamlining the onboarding process and enhancing sales team efficiency.

In addition, architectural blueprints were meticulously created using LucidChart. These diagrams illustrated the interplay between high-level system components, defining their communication pathways and specifying component responsibilities. These combined efforts laid a robust foundation for both current and future product work, ensuring the continued growth and success of Improovy.
