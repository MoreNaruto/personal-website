## Summary

When optimizing ship deliveries, having an open and effective dialogue with stakeholders was crucial. One key step in this process was clearly explaining the technical blueprint for the platform's implementation and showing how it would increase efficiency.

On the tech side, we executed everything with precision. We built a robust application using Kotlin and the agile Micronaut framework. This innovative solution was designed to improve communication between truckers and shipment managers, addressing gaps in the logistics process.

To further enhance communication, we seamlessly integrated Twilio, enabling the system to send automated text messages, a vital tool in coordinating shipments. Additionally, we incorporated Google My Maps, allowing the shipment team to create custom maps tailored to each facility. This feature greatly improved their daily operations by making generating and displaying personalized maps easy, leading to unparalleled convenience and better overall efficiency. This holistic approach not only streamlined deliveries but also revolutionized communication in the shipping industry.
