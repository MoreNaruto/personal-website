## Key Points  

1. Create an event aggregated system that allows a social justice organization to raise awareness of the injustices and corruption in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
   * Ruby on Rails w/ ActiveRecord
   * Front End Development with traditional javascript
   * The Pipeline Environment managed by Snap
   * Server hosted by Heroku

2. An educational-based system that allowed students to keep track of their accomplishments and achievements in certain classes.
   * C#/.NET with MySQL/Postgres as the database framework
   * Front End Development with traditional javascript
   * Pipeline environments managed by Jenkins
   * Servers hosted internally

3. A financial management system for a fashion company that allowed them to automate manual processes for their financial team better

   * Front End Development with ReactJS
   * Pipeline environments managed by Snap

4. An event sourcing system for a banking company to keep better track of record and recovery management
   * Spring Java w/Axon framework w/SQL [CQRS Pattern]
   * Front End Development with ReactJs
   * Compiler [Maven]
   * Build Tool [Gradle]
   * Pipeline Environment in Go w/ Chef as configuration manager

## Summary

* For a social justice organization focused on raising awareness about injustices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I created an event aggregation system. The backend was developed using Ruby on Rails with ActiveRecord, while the frontend utilized traditional JavaScript. The system was deployed on a pipeline environment managed by Snap and hosted on Heroku.
* In the educational domain, I designed a system enabling students to track their accomplishments in specific classes. This system was built using C#/.NET with MySQL/Postgres databases. Traditional JavaScript was used for the frontend, and pipeline environments were managed by Jenkins, with servers hosted internally.
* For a fashion company's financial management, I developed a system aimed at automating manual processes. The backend was implemented using Ruby on Sinatra with MySQL, and the frontend was built with ReactJS. The deployment process was streamlined using pipeline environments managed by Snap.
* In the banking sector, I engineered an event sourcing system to improve record and recovery management. This system was developed using Spring Java with the Axon framework, following the CQRS pattern, and relied on SQL databases. The frontend was constructed using ReactJs. The build process utilized Maven and Gradle, with the pipeline environment managed in Go and configured with Chef as the configuration manager.
