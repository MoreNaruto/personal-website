## Introduction

My name is Thomas Morris and I have a lovely wife and two kids (a 7-year old boy and a 7-month old girl).
I have been a developer for around 10 years and have worked in multiple different business domains and
programming languages. By title, I'm a Fullstack developer (currently my official title is Expert Application Engineer),
but I wear many hats depending on what the company needs from me.
